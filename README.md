> components with vue

## Noted

They are some components I may use during my job or, you know, fun stuff. And more important is that I can code for something to kill my time.

Each components may have a `readme` file in it, which is to explain how it works. It is actually more like a rule to force me to write docs after coding.

Punch me in the face if you can't find any docs in any components.

## Dev step

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If it can't work, try `sudo`. Then check it in `localhost: 3000`.

Done talking, time to code.

By the way, Vue is gas!
